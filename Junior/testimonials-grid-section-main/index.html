            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I 
            learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. 
            I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

            "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition
            and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here, I signed up for the free intro course and 
            and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best-and most grueling-time
            of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at 
            a VR startup"

            Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp
            themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy.

            "The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The
            program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present
            myself as a capable junior developer. the standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention
            you need from and incredible community of smart and amazing people."

            "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
            professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
            student of theirs who can only say wonderfull things about the program. The entire currilum and staff did not disappoint. 
            The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I nver had to wait long for assistance.
            The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. I took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial cloudflare
            ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as and example of my develpent experience. It 
            certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"
